# Akira Status

### Technologies used:
* redux: https://redux.js.org/
* redux-thunk: https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk
* semantic-ui-react: https://react.semantic-ui.com/
* react-live-clock: https://github.com/pvoznyuk/react-live-clock

The most time was spent on trying to get material-ui-react to work
the way I laid out, before deciding to switch to semantic-ui-react.

### Things I would like to work on in the future:
* Transitions
* Header bar w/ logo
